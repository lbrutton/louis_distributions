## Binomial and Gaussian distributions in Python

This repository contains three Python classes: Generaldistribution, Gaussian and Binomial, to be used for probabilistic calculations in Python. It was built as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

## Contents of the repository:

-  louis_distributions folder: 
	- Binomialdistribution.py: contains the Binomial distribution class
    - Gaussiandistribution.py: contains the Gaussian distribution class
    - Generaldistribution.py: contains a parent class with shared methods, which the other two classes inherit from
    - __init__.py: required for pip packages, and includes shortcuts to allow users to directly access the classes after importing the modules
- license.txt: required for upload to PyPi or TestPyPi: contains basic copyright information, taken from the MIT template
- setup.cfg: required for upload to PyPi, contains basic file metadata

## Libraries used:

import math  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

This entire project was built as part of an exercise in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course.
